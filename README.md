# 🚀 Machine Learning Project – SONAR Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify objects as **Rock** or **Mine** using the **SONAR dataset**.  
The goal is to demonstrate an end-to-end machine learning workflow using Python and real-world data.

The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Given sonar signal data, predict whether the detected object is a **Rock (R)** or a **Mine (M)**.  
This is a **binary classification problem** widely used to evaluate machine learning models.
